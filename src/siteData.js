He would yell from the fence line during softball games for me to get ready andkeep my eye on the ball.  My dad had this whistle that could burst eardrums and he would use it at nearly every Muncie Central basketball game!  Dad would take us to the bowling alley when he would bowl in his league.  He tried to explain golf, but we never really got past the miniture golf course.  I would be too much of a hazard at a regualr course.  I am so appreciatitve for the time we had and the memories we have shared. Love always, daddy's little girl.",
